# Advent-of-Code-Day-2-2021-Python

**What is Advent of Code**
Advent of code is online game for programmers with really difficult questions that need to be solved through coding. You may use any type of programming language but I used Python in this case. Please do not use this to cheat your way up, this is for educational purposes to help you understand.

**IMPORTANT**
Day2files are the files that will be used in the Day2 program, you just need to copy your puzzle input to Day2files. And also, please do change your file path in Day2.py because if you don't you will get an error, I have mentioned it there too.
